# Paraphrase Identification with PAWS Dataset

## Introduction

This project tackles the problem of paraphrase identification using the PAWS (Paraphrase Adversaries from Word Scrambling) dataset. Paraphrase identification involves determining whether two sentences express the same meaning, even though they are phrased differently. It is a vital task in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, including text summarization, information retrieval, and question-answering systems.

We were inspired by the research paper “PAWS: Paraphrase Adversaries from Word Scrambling” by Yuan Zhang, Jason Baldridge, and Luheng He. Our goal was to replicate and explore the results presented in the paper. The paper presents challenging adversarial examples where sentences that share almost all words are not paraphrases, which makes accurate paraphrase detection more difficult.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to identify whether two given sentences are paraphrases, using various methodologies that include both traditional and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The primary dataset used is PAWS, which presents unique challenges due to the adversarial examples.
